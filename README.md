## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to set up the **Arogya Nabha** application for development or testing.

### 1. Prerequisites

You must have the following installed: **Node.js** (version 16 or higher recommended), **npm** or **yarn**, **Git**, and a running **MongoDB** instance.

### 2. Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/NishitSK/arogya-nabha.git](https://github.com/NishitSK/arogya-nabha.git)
    cd arogya-nabha
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named **`.env`** in the root directory and add your configuration details. At a minimum, this must include your MongoDB connection string and a secret key:

    ```bash
    # Example .env file content
    MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/arogya-nabha-db" 
    PORT=5000
    JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SECURE_RANDOM_SECRET" 
    # Add any other API keys (e.g., for mapping/video) here
    ```

### 3. Install Dependencies and Run

The project has two main parts: the `backend` (Express) and the `frontend` (React/Vite/Tailwind).

#### A. Backend (Express.js)

1.  Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
2.  Start the Express server:
    ```bash
    npm run start 
    # or use 'npm run dev' if you have a nodemon script
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### B. Frontend (React/Vite/Tailwind)

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend 
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will typically open at `http://localhost:5173`.
